Quotebot
===========

python project with accompanying script to write quotes to a file, or be able to randomly get a quote from the same file.

Inspiration: my probability and statistics teacher says some funny stuff, so I wanted to be able to capture what he said forever in a file, and then sometimes read them off. Also it would be cool to just arbitrarily throw quotes into a file.
